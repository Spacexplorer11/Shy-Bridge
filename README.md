<!--# sv

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```sh
# create a new project in the current directory
npx sv create

# create a new project in my-app
npx sv create my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```sh
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```sh
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.

# What is this?

This is a silly little project made for Summer of Making Grand Survey - a event where people had to make small website which are linked to more scenes  
Basically I made this for Scene 29 which is about a shy bridge. That inspired me to make a... you'll never guess... a shy bridge! _Wow!_ Anyways, I hope you like my project.

## How to self host?

Idk why you would want to self host this but if you do, here are the steps:

- Clone repo
- Run `npm install` or whatever package manager you use
- Run `npm run dev --open` to open the project in your browser or any package manager.
  For your info this project uses **Bun** so I'd reccommend using that but afaik other package managers can be used.
